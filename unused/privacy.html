                We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a
                particularly high priority
                for the management of the ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS. The use of the Internet pages of the ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS is
                possible without
                any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via
                our website,
                processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and
                there is no
                statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
            </p>
            <p class="p-3" style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
                The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a
                data subject shall
                always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the
                country-specific data
                protection regulations applicable to ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS. By means of this data protection declaration,
                our enterprise
                would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we
                collect, use and
                process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the
                rights to which
                they are entitled.
            </p>
            <p class="p-3" style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
                As the controller, the ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures
                to ensure the
                most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data
                transmissions may
                in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every
                data subject is
                free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.

                The Internet pages of the ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a
                computer system via
                an Internet browser.
            </p>
            <p class="p-3" style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
                Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is
                a unique
                identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can
                be assigned to
                the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and
                servers to
                differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other
                cookies. A
                specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.

                Through the use of cookies, the ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS can provide the users of this website with more
                user-friendly services
                that would not be possible without the cookie setting.

            <p class="p-3" style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
                By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind.
                Cookies allow
                us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make
                it easier for
                users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access
                data each time the
                website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the
                user's computer
                system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers
                the articles that
                a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.

                The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a
                corresponding
                setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore,
                already set
                cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible
                in all popular
                Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used,
                not all
                functions of our website may be entirely usable.

                Collected may be (1)
                the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the

                the data
                subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2)
                optimize the

                necessary for criminal
                prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS analyzes anonymously collected

                enterprise, and to

                Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller
                the erasure of
                personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to
                erase personal
                data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not
                necessary:

            <ul>
                <li>The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected

                <li>The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of
                    Article 6(1) of the GDPR,
                    or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the
                    processing.</li>
                <li>The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no
                    overriding legitimate
                    grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2)
                    of the GDPR.</li>

                <li>The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law

                <li>The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services
                    referred to in Article
                    8(1) of the GDPR.</li>

                If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored

                SOLUTIONS shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.
                Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data,
                the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps,
                including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has
                requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as
                processing is not required. The employees of the ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS will arrange the necessary measures in individual
                cases.

            processing where one of the following applies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the
                accuracy of the personal data.</li>
                <li>The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests restriction of
                their use instead.</li>
                <li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data
                subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
                <li>The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the
                legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-3" style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing
            of personal data stored by the ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The
            employee of the ZEROSEC SOLUTIONS will arrange the restriction of the processing.
