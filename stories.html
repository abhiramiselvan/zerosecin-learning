                Working for Zerosec Solutions Pvt. Ltd. is a fantastic opportunity. I am able to care for my child
                because it allows me to work from home. We were able to pay off our loan because I can financially
                support my husband. I am proud to be an independent working woman. I will appreciate Zerosec's
                commitment to equal employment opportunities.

                After graduation, I was lucky enough to get a job at Zerosec as a moderator. Zerosec has helped me in

                Despite my desire to be financially independent, I needed to look for work from home opportunities
                because my baby was only four months old. Then I went to work for Zerosec, a company that offers remote
                work opportunities. I was thrilled to be a part of such a forward-thinking organisation. However, due to
                personal circumstances, I was forced to resign from my position. Despite the fact that I was only there
                for a short time, I will always cherish the memories I made at Zerosec.

                I was overjoyed when I was offered a job in the same field because I have always been interested in
                product and quality analysis. Mr. Navaneethan has always been a great boss and a pillar of support for
                me, so I was able to advance in my career. I learned the value of time management and quality practices,
                and I was able to communicate effectively with my coworkers. This experience was extremely beneficial to
                me during my college years, as I was able to complete projects on time with high quality. Thank you very
                much, Zerosec!

                Due to my family situation, I was finding it very difficult to continue my studies.
                During that time, I was given the opportunity to work as a part-time employee for Zerosec Solutions. The
                encouragement and support that I received from Mr. Navaneethan, the co-founder, was invaluable in
                helping me achieve my goals. Also, I'm happy to say that nearly 40 to 50 students have graduated while
                working part-time at Zerosec Solution. I am really grateful to Zerosec for all the help and support they
                have given me.

                When I was studying up my chemical engineering studies at Erode, I started working part-time at Zerosec
                solution. It was great working with Mr. Navaneethan Kandaraj, the owner and head of Zerosec Solutions.
                He is very passionate about his work and always puts the needs of his employees first. I worked there
                for four years. I was also able to save some money, which was extremely beneficial to me and my family.
                However, due to personal reasons, I recently left Zerosec Solutions with a heavy heart. But, I will
                always cherish the memories and experiences I had at Zerosec. I will never forget his kindness and
                guidance.
